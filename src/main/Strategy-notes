                //RECOGNISING AN EYE https://senseis.xmp.net/?RecognizingAnEye


                //Maximise a group's liberties

                //Ladders: capture lone stones by surrounding them from the side
                //Nets: break potential connection by playing in between. More efficient than ladder (make sure to add ladder breakers)

                //Prevent atari from being recaptured by claiming stone on diagonal

                //Reduce eyespace using placement moves

                //Hane - reaching around opponents stones. Natural response to direct contact from opponent
                    //Do not hane a supported stone. Instead go straight from them

                //Throw-in - a sacrifice stone played at the point where the enemy wants to connect, giving rise to a false eye, shortage of liberties, snapback, oiotoshi (connect-and-die), or squeeze.
                    //“Capturing 2 stones makes a false eye”

                //A one-point jump is often a good move. It is not easy to cut this shape successfully, and it is a fast way to jump out towards the center. Play one if you don’t know what else to play.
                //“Even a moron connects against a peep.” - connect stones if in middle, or add one outward if shoulderchecked
                //An extension along the side is the best way to make a base and avoid getting attacked. In making a base, the best extension is the height of the wall, plus 1.
                    //That means: for two stones next to each other, extend with 2+1 jump (3 empty spaces)

                //Bamboo joint (2 stone, 2 empty, 2 stone

                //Respond to cap with a knights move - preferably towards opponents tiles

            //creating eyes protects chains -> more than 1 safeguards against suicide move

//ending

//if no good move available => pass
