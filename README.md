# GO

The module contains two runnable classes:
- A server that hosts GO games for two people.
- A client that allows a user to connect and play GO on this, or another server using the same protocol.

To set up the server, run the GoServer class. Follow the instructions in the console.

To set up a client, run the GoController class. If you are the first to connect, it will ask for input
about the settings for the game you want to play.
