# GO
To set up playing the GO, please clone the repository, and run the two runnable classes provided in the GO module:
- GoServer: A server that hosts GO games for two people.
- GoController: A client that allows a user to connect and play GO on this, or another server using the same protocol.

To set up the server, run the GoServer class. Follow the instructions in the console.

To set up a client, first ensure the server port number has been selected. Run the GoController class, and select the server.
If you are the first to connect, it will ask for input
about the settings for the game you want to play.
